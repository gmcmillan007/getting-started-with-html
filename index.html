  <p><b>What I learned this week</b></p>

<b>Main Concepts</b></p>

<b>What is the Web? </b>The Web is all the HTML documents that exist in the largest network, which is a series of servers.

<p><b>What is HTML? </b>HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language.  It is the language browsers interpret as what we see as 
pages in the Internet. At the end it is a programming language. There are over 20 billion HTML pages on the Internet.</p>

<p><b> What are URLs? </b>URL stands for Uniform Resource Locator. It is the standard to request information and 
locate HTML pages on the Internet. A URL is sent to the server that stores the page requested.  The server sends 
back the right page to be interpreted by the browser on your computer.</p>

<p><b>What is HTTP? </b>It stands for Hyper Text Transfer Protocol, which is the protocol, or series of standardize instructions that the Internet uses to link HTML pages.</p></b>

<b>Web Applications </b>were briefly mentioned as the goal for this course.</p>

<p><b>How does the Internet Works? </p></b>
<p>User sends a request from a device </p>
<p>The URL requested goes to the Internet </p>
<p>Through the HTTP protocol it is located in a server </p>
<p>The server sends the requested URL through HTTP </p>
<p>The URL travels through the Internet </p>
<p>The user’s browser interprets the HTML Page for 
the user to read/see/listen.</p>

<p><b>What is a Tag?</b> A Tag is an HTML label describing the content of an HTML page. Tags are always contained within a less than and a more than brackets. And in most cases are used in pairs, an opening tag “(tag)” and a closing tag “(/tag)".</p>

<p><b>What is a Void Tag? </b>A Void Tag has no content and therefore does not require a closing tag. 
Examples of a void tag are the bracket tag “(br), and image tag “(img)”.</p>

<p><b>What is an Inline Tag? </b>Inline Tags are simple line tags. That is, they are not contained in boxes. Examples are: the (br), (img), (em), (b) tags, etc.</p>

<p><b>What is an Block Tag? </b>Block Tags are always contained in boxes (although not always seen as such through their representation of the content. Examples are: The paragraph tag “(p)(/p)”, the anchor tag “(a)(/a)”, or the division tag “(div)(/div).</p>

<p><b>What is an Element?</b> An Element is everything that is contained between an opening and a closing tag.</p>

<p><b>What is an Attribute? </b>Attributes are properties assigned to the content in a tag, such as color, font, size, location, border size, etc.</p>
